This simulation tests how two differently behaving players do against each other in a game of rock, paper and scissors.

Each player decides on which hand to play, based on influence by the individual behaviors they possess.

In the below examples, **Goliath** is always defined by the same set of behaviors, but **David**'s behaviors are added randomly on each run.

Example output :

    'David': { History, Instinct, Influential, Paranoid, Gifted, Stubborn }

      against

    'Goliath': { History, Instinct, Stupid, Brute, Influential }

    Results over 3 turns (with 1 tie):

     'David' won 2 times`

Other behaviors :

    'David': { History, Instinct, Influential, Stupid, Cheating, Gifted }

      against

    'Goliath': { History, Instinct, Stupid, Brute, Influential }

    Results over 3 turns

     'David' won 3 times
